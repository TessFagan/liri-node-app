# liri-node-app

What the project does:
LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
The parameters are 4 different functions that can be used to call 3 APIs, or read data from a text file

Why the project is useful:
This project was a great learning experience if you are interested in learning about APIs and functions

How users can get started with the project:
Download the git repository and run the file using node from the command line.

Where users can get help with your project:
This app is not going to be supported in the future, since there are more efficient and user friendly ways to listen to a song, or find out information about a movie.

Who maintains and contributes to the project:
Tess Fagan created and contributed to this project.
